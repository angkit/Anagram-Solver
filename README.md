# Anagram-Solver
Solves large anagrams using Tensorflow
Here we try to solve anagrams using seq2seq package of Tensorflow. The file dicn.py is for creating the dictionary and preprocessing the raw text file into integer tokens. The model.py trains the alogorithm as well as tests the algorithm on development set.
